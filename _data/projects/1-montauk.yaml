desc: Located in Montauk, New York, the sustainable residence was designed for a specific client. The client, a divorced writer in her 30s, asked for a spacious home that can accomodate the needs of her, her son, and elderly mother. As per request, the home was designed to be sustainable, support aging-in-place, and provide the client's son with a place to stay every other weekend. Through careful space planning and research the needs of the client were met.

    text:  Inspired by how plants are connected to the earth by their roots, the residence  explores the concept of roots being the lifeline that keeps nature alive. This "root like" structure influences the design of the floor plan. The rooms are connected by branch like glass hallways that fill the space with natural light.
